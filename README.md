# Deep-Learning-Project


## Introduction
This is the Github Repository of our Deep Learning Project, where we worked on Time Series Benchmarking. We benchmarked a few models: NBeats (a pure deep learning model
developed by Element AI), Prophets (a statistical model developed by Facebook), and ES-RNN (a hybrid model developed by Smyl, winner of the M4 competition).

This README file only contains a summary of our findings of the various models. For a summary on the more theoretical aspects of the models, refer to the links below.
